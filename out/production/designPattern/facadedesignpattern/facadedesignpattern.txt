FACADE DESIGN PATTERN :

When we used this Design pattern::
jab bhi hama system complexity hide karni ho aur client ko naa dekhni ho ki jab bhi client kuch kaam kara bo kaam ho jaya par use
pata na ho ki us kaam karna ka liya kya kiya ho back side main.

Example 1 SCHENERIO 1:

There are design of Employee how to insert step by step.

1. Create a EmployeeDAO with method --> insert(),create(),getById(id),getByEmail(email) and other method.
2. Create a EmployeeFacade know only 2 method to perform a action --- So we need EmployeeDAO
   and the Relation b/w  (EmployeeFacade  {HAS-A}----> EmployeeDAO) and they have used a insert(),create() method
3. Create a EmpClient and its hold a ! method to getEmpDetails() ---  A=and they have    **EmployeeFacade **
    So the relation b/w  (EmpClient {HAS-A}---->>> EmployeeFacade) and use the getEmployeeById()
