#Is a Relationship : It is inheritance



#has a Relationship : Mean one class is depend to other

it has 3 type:

1.Association
2.Aggregation
3.Composition


Association : Jab 2 ya 2 sa jadha class ka Beech main Relationship
              Jab **Ek class dusra Class ka Object ko use kara**
              Jaisa Hum *Aggregation And Composition* main dekh rah hai


** But Aggregation And Composition is a part of *Association*

Aggregation : Depend but it is lousily Coupled
              Suppose there are Two Class University and Department
              *University is dependent to Department*
              So there are loose coupling.
              If One Department is remove than no issue in University.

Composition : Depend but it is Tightly Coupled
              Suppose we have Two class Car And Engine
              *Car is Depend to Engine*
              So car is Tightly coupled with Engine
              If Engine in not in Car than we have not create a Car.
