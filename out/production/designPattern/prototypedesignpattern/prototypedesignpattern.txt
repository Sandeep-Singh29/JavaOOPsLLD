PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN : It is used when we have to make copy/clone from Existing Object.

Basically in PROTOTYPE we have clone tha base Object and change into new Object.


ISSUE WHEN WE FOLLOW THIS PATTERN ::
Suppose :

Student Class :
int age , String name , private int rollNumber.

1. Create a Non Parameter Constructor
2. Create a All Parameter Constructor

3. Create a Main Test Class
4. Create a base Student :: > >
 **Student baseStudent = new Student(27,"Sandeep,100); // baseStudent object created

5.Now Clone all filed in Other cloneStudent Object;

6. Student cloneStudent = new Student();
cloneStudent.name = baseStudent.name;
cloneStudent.age = baseStudent.age;
cloneStudent.rollNumber = baseStudent.rollNumber; // In this line we have error because rollNumber is private so we have not access it.

Problem in this Pattern if we have direct access and clone object.

Suppose we have multiple field and craete a multiple class of clone object
so we have manually change assign filed and clone . It will take a lots of time
and also private field and access so we have not clone the baseObject.



SOLVE PROBLEM FOR THIS PATTERN ::

1. Create a base Interface and create a abstract method clone().
2. If any class need and prototype then we have to implement a clone().
