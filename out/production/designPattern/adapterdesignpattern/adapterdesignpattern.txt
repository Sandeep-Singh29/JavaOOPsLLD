ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN :

Adapter design pattern ek Bridge ka kaam karta hai / isko beech ka mediator bhi bol sakta hai.

Example 1 :

Suppose MERI meeting ek Germany ka CLIENT sa hai Aur CLIENT germany main hi bolta hai but mujhe germany nahi ati
to Ek Mera FRIEND hai jo Germany smjh leta hai .
Client jo bolta hai mera friend Convert karka mujhe Hindi main samjha deta hai.

** isma sabhi ka role kya hai

GERMANY_CLIENT(client hai) ----------> FRIEND(ADAPTER)-----------> ME(EXISTING ADAPTER)

Main yahi hai adaptor main.

agar STARTING aur END User main koi issue ata hai to Adapter isko solve karta hau like a ADAPTER(Mediator)


EXAMPLE 2:

Pound to KG Calculator

Most of the people is not understand weight in Pound so

Client is put request in pound and we need to return and as In KG
and in Mid Man ADAPTER(Mediator) is Convert a Pound to Kg and return to Client.
