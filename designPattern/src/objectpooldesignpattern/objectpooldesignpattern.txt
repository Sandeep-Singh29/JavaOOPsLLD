CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN :
- Manages the pool of reusable objects like DBConnection Object.
- Borrow(Udhar) form pool -> use it -> then return it back to the pool.



ADVANTAGES :

- Reduce the overhead of creating and destroying the frequently required object(general resource intensive objects).
- Reduce the latency , as it uses the pre initialized object.
- Prevent Resource exhaustion by managing the number of resource intensive object creation.


DISADVANTAGES :

- Resource leakage can happen, if object is not handle properly and not being returned to the pool.
- Required more memory bcz of managing the pool.
- Pool management required thread safety , which is additional overhead.
- Adds application complexity bcz of managing the pool.
