TEMPLATE DESIGN PATTERN :

WHEN WE REQUIRED AND USE :
- When you want all classes to follow the specific steps to process the task but also
  Need to provide the flexibility that each class can have their own logic in that specific steps.


REAL WORLD EXAMPLE :


- Main client hu aur main payment send kar raha hu Aur yaha par different-2 Payment mode hai
1. Using UPI
2. Using Merchant
3. Using Card
4. Using Bussiness Account

- Sabhi ka Payment Flow same hoga
- But Different hoga logic Like :
* Merchant main Fees Charges hai : 2%
* Bussiness main Fees Charges hai : 0%
* UPI main Fees Charges hai : 0%
* Card main Fees Charges hai : 5%

- To Jab bhi hum Payment Process karaga to Individual ka Logic implement karaga.
