Question Asked in Walmart in LLD Round;

Question : Suppose we have open a Flipkart app and Check Samsung S25 Ultra but it is Sold out
           but in Bottom right show me a button (NOTIFY). If USer Click the Notify Button
           When we Phone is Available in App User give Notification that Phone is Available
           Please Buy It.

           So How can You design This Pattern in LLD.



SOLUTION :

In This Pattern there Are 2 Object

1. OBSERVABLE(STATE)
2. OBSERVER(USER)

OBSERVABLE (Like a Notify Button): Iski different-different state hogi like, NOT_AVAILABLE,SOLD OUT,LAUNCHED
            Iska Kaam bus yahi hai jab bhi state change hogi to ya OBSERVER(USER) ko Notification(message) dega.

State- > (1,NOT_AVAILABLE), (SOLD OUT,2) ,(LAUNCHED,3)
        Agar koi Bhi state Change hogi to OBSERVER(USER) ko Notification Jayaga.





IMPLEMENTATION :

OBSERVABLE Interface :

add() like a registration
1. Method is --  List<ObserverInterface> obj; , add(ObserverInterface obj)  , remove(ObserverInterface obj)   , notify() , setData()
2. OBSERVABLE Interface Has a RelationShip with OBSERVER Interface
3. Create a Observable(Concreate) class Is a Relation for Implementation a OBSERVABLE Interface Method

OBSERVER Interface

1. Method is -- update()
2. Create a OBSERVER(Concreate class) to Implement a Update()
3. OBSERVER(Concreate class) Has a Relationship with Observable(Concreate) class
