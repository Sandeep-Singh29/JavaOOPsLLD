Factory Design Pattern :

When we Used :

Jab Mera Pas Multiple Input ho aur ki basis par mujhe kuch create karna ho
Jiski Implementation milagi use main return kar duga.


Example : There are different different shape

1.Circle
2.Rectangle
3.Square
4.Triangle

If user Input Circle than out will we circle.


** Lets Understand how to implement a Factory Design Pattern **

1. First Create a Shape Interface with draw() method
2. Now Create Different Different Class And implement a draw() >>>  So this will  **is-a** relationship
3. Than we have create a Class ShapeFactory and Inject a Shape interface
        -- >> So this will  ShapeFactory -- has a -- RelationShip with Shape interface
4. Than than we have create a method getShape(String shape) in   ShapeFactory -- And in this method we have
     write logic if user input circle than we have return a new Circle Object;
