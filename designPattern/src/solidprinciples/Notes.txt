SOLID Principles Advantages :

S- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):- A class should have only 1 reason to Change.

O- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Open for Extension(implements) but Closed for Modification.

L- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): If Class B is Subtype of Class A, then we should we able to replace
                                         object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program.
    ** Class Should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down.

I- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces should be such,that client should not implement
                                            unnecessary functions they do not need.

D- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Class Should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class


Advantages :

-Avoid duplicate code
-Easy to Maintain
-Easy to Understand
-Flexible Software
-Reduce Complexity
